# patient_management_system

This PHP MySQL-based system keeps track of a patient from the time they get to the hospital to the time they are discharged... 
Whether outpatients or those in need of admission, from the reception where the patient is created and optionally assigned an available 
doctor, to the diagnosis and test suggestions by the doctor, to the laboratory (if need be) 
for testing, back to the doctor for the determination of the right medical drugs to be 
administered to the pharmacist and to the nurse (if admitted). Also included is the tracking of
finances for private hospitals for the services and materials used
